This four week course focuses on migrating workloads to AWS.  We will focus on  analyzing your current environment, planning your migration, AWS services that are commonly used during your migration, and the actual migration steps.  

Hands-on labs are available, though not required for this class.  Access to the labs is limited to paid enrolled students.  You can audit this  course without taking the labs.  As we dive into each of the services covered in this class, there will be links to documentation where you can find example applications and code samples.

If you are new to AWS, we strongly suggest that you take “AWS Fundamentals: Going Cloud Native” (https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-fundamentals-going-cloud-native) course available on Coursera to provide an introduction to AWS concepts and services.
